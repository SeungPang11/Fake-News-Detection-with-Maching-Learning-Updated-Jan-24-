## Methods
____**TF-IDF**____<br />
* Transform texts (news titles) into a meaningful representation of numbers while removing stopwords.

__**SMOTE**__<br />
* Before SMOTE, the model was good at detecting real news (shown by high True Positive score),<br /> 
while performing poorly at detecting fake news (shown by low True Negative score).<br /> 

* SMOTE is used to tweak the model to reduce False Negatives, at the cost of increasing False Positives.<br /> 

* The result of using SMOTE is generally an increase in recall, at the cost of lower precision.

__**Naive Bayes**__<br />
* Naive Bayes is an algorithm based on the Bayes Theorem and is widely used for classification <br /> 
and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

__**Logistic Regression**__<br />
* Logistic regression classifier is used for modeling the probability of a discrete outcome given an input variable.

__**Support Vector Machine**__<br />
* SVM algorithm finds a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space(the number of features) that distinctly classifies the data points.

__**XGBoost**__<br />
* XGBoost is based on the gradient-boosted trees algorithm, which is a supervised learning algorithm.<br /> 
* It attempts to predict a target variable by combining the estimates of a set of simpler models.

## Result - Updated Dec 2023
* Updated text pre-processing to remove emojis 
* Improved performance
* 

## Previous Result
* Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes were the best performing models for fake news detection.
* By combining Politifact and GossipCop datasets then utilizing Logistic Regression and SMOTE, 
the F1 score improved from **0.63 to 0.65**.
* FakeNewsNetâ€™s F1 scores for GossipCop dataset are higher due to the greater number of real news compared to the number of fake news.

* Confusion Matrix - Before and After SMOTE

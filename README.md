## Methods
_**Feature Engineering**_<br />
* **Word Count**: The number of words in news titles. <br>
* **Retweet Count**: The number of times in news has been tweeted/ retweeted. <br>
* **TF-IDF**: Transform text into a representation of numbers while removing stopwords. <br>
* **Sentiment**: Emotional tone of news (Polarity [-1,1], Sensitivity [0,1]) <br>

_**Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE)**_<br />
* Oversample minority class to tweak the model <br />
(reduce False Negatives, at the cost of increasing False Positives).<br /> 
The result is generally an increase in recall, at the cost of lower precision.

* Before SMOTE, the model was good at detecting real news (high True Positives),<br /> 
while performing poorly at detecting fake news (low True Negatives).<br /> 

_**Naive Bayes**_<br />
* Based on conditional probability (Bayes Theorem), probability of an event <br />
occurring given another event already happened, and assumes all features equally <br />
affect the outcome.

_**Logistic Regression**_<br />
* Models the probability of a discrete outcome given input variables.

_**Support Vector Machine**_<br />
* Finds a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space (# of features)  <br />
that distinctly classifies the data points.<br /> 
Computationally intensive and works better on small data with large features.

_**XGBoost**_<br />
* Based on the gradient-boosted trees algorithm which predicts <br />
a target variable by combining the estimates of a set of simpler models.

## Result - Updated Jan 2024
* Updated text pre-processing to better remove emojis, URLs, and special characters <br>
* Cross Validation to evaluate model performance <br>
* Tested oversampling minority class & undersampling majority class <br>
* **Improved performance**

 -Achieved a **significantly improved F1** score from previous performance <br>
 -**Recall is more important** than Precision (Classifying Fake News as Real News is worse)<br>
 -**Best Performance:** Bernoulli Naive Bayes (Higher Recall and F1) <br>
 -**Worst Performance:** SVM (works best with high dimensional and large data) <br>
  and computationally intensive

*FakeNewsNetâ€™s F1 scores for the GossipCop dataset are higher due to <br/>
the greater number of real news than the number of fake news.
